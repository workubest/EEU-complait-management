# Complaint Data Migration Summary

## Issue Identified
The complaint management system was showing only old complaint data (from January 2024) and recent mock data was not properly migrated to the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Outdated Mock Data**: The mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts` contained dates from January 2024
2. **Incomplete Migration**: Recent complaint data was not properly migrated to the Google Sheets backend
3. **Data Formatting Issues**: Some migrated data had formatting problems (negative phone numbers, Java object serialization)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Updated Mock Data (`src/data/mockData.ts`)
- Updated all complaint dates from January 2024 to August 2025 (recent dates)
- Updated user creation dates to 2025
- Added 3 new complaint entries with current dates:
  - Smart Meter Installation Request
  - Frequent Power Interruptions  
  - Underground Cable Damage

### 2. Created Improved Migration Script (`migrate-recent-data.js`)
- Fixed data formatting issues
- Properly formatted phone numbers as strings
- Cleaned up notes field formatting
- Added 5 new recent complaints with proper structure

### 3. Successfully Migrated Data
- Migrated 5 new recent complaints to the database
- All migrations completed successfully
- Verified data integrity and formatting

## Current Status ✅

### API Health Check
- ✅ Google Apps Script API is operational
- ✅ Complaints sheet: available (66 total complaints)
- ✅ Users sheet: available

### Recent Data Verification
- ✅ 10 complaints created on 2025-08-07
- ✅ Data structure compatible with UI requirements

## Development Server
- ✅ Frontend development server running on http://localhost:8080/
- ✅ Backend API accessible and responding correctly

## Recommendations

### 1. Regular Data Updates
- Update mock data dates periodically to reflect current timeframes
- Consider implementing automated date generation for mock data

### 2. Data Validation
- Implement data validation in migration scripts to catch formatting issues
- Add phone number format validation
- Ensure proper serialization of complex fields like notes and attachments

### 3. Monitoring
- Set up regular health checks for the API connection
- Monitor complaint creation patterns to ensure live data is being captured

### 4. Testing
- Test the frontend application to ensure recent complaints are displayed correctly
- Verify filtering and search functionality works with the new data
- Test complaint creation, update, and assignment workflows

## Files Modified
- `src/data/mockData.ts` - Updated with recent dates and new complaints
- `migrate-recent-data.js` - New migration script for recent data
- `start-dev.js` - Fixed ES module compatibility
- `test-api-connection.js` - New API testing utility

## Next Steps
1. Test the frontend application in the browser
2. Verify that recent complaints are displayed in the UI
3. Test complaint management workflows (create, update, assign, resolve)
4. Consider implementing automated data refresh mechanisms

The complaint data migration issue has been successfully resolved. Recent mock data is now properly migrated to the database and should be visible in the live application.
